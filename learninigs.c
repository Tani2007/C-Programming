//? What are Keywords?
// todo --> keywods are some reserved words in the  world of programming language. Example - return ,char ,printf,int .

//? What are identifiers?
//todo --> identifiers could be a name of any function variable so that we can identify it.  

//! Data Type tells us that which type of data is gonna come in that variable.

//todo--> Variables --> a name given to a memory location. you can declare it like ,
//! int a,b,c,d; --> here we have declare 4 variables abcd and we can assign values to then anytime.
//! int a = 5; -> inetialize and declared at same time.
//! float a = 5.5;//for decimal use  float an double

//?Variable can contain --> digit alpa underscore and no whitespace is allowed between the variable and no reserved keyword is allowed and it can not start with a digit,

//todo--> DataTypes
//? Basic Data Type = int char float double
//? Derived Data Type = array , pointer ,structure ,union 
//?Enumeration Data Type = emum
//? Viod Data Type = void
//? to check the memeory size of that datatype use the below command.
//!printf("%lu",sizeof(char));

//todo--> to print any program use this command --> printf("%d",3+7)//output = 10 
//todo --> to get the value from the user use this code --> 
//! int a;
//! scanf("%d",&a);
